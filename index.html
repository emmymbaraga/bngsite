			<h3>Ibyo wamenya kuri 5G</h3>
			<p>China's mobile operators have made 5G services available to consumers, as the country seeks to become a global technology leader.

             State-owned carriers China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom unveiled their 5G data plans on Thursday.

            It comes as Beijing and Washington have been embroiled in a power struggle over trade and technology.

            South Korea, the US and the UK have all rolled out their next generation 5G networks this year.

            5G is the fifth-generation of mobile internet connectivity. It promises much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections.

				<h2>Types of Backups</h2>  
            <p>There are more than ten different types of data backup. Here are four of the most common ones.

             <h3>Full backup</h3>  

             As the name implies, a full backup is when every single file and folder in the system is backed up. A full backup takes longer and requires more space than other types of backups but the process of restoring lost data from backup is much faster.

             <h3>Incremental backup</h3>

             With incremental backup, only the initial backup is a full one. Subsequent backups only stores changes that were made since the previous backup. The process of restoring lost data from backup is longer but the backup process is much quicker.

             <h3>Differential backup</h3>

             Differential backup is similar to incremental backup. With both, the initial backup is full and subsequent backups only store changes made to files since the last backup. This type of backup requires more storage space than incremental backup does, however, but it also allows for a faster restore time.

             <h3>Mirror backup</h3>

             A mirror backup, as the name implies, is when an exact copy is made of the source data. The advantage of mirror backup as opposed to full, incremental, or differential backups, is that you’re not storing old, obsolete files. When obsolete files are deleted, they disappear from the mirror backup as well when the system backs up. The downside to mirror backup is that if files are accidentally deleted, they can be lost from the backup is well if the deletion isn’t discovered before the next scheduled backup.

			<p>The Chinese carriers had initially scheduled the launch for next year, but accelerated the rollout.

               The superfast service is now available to consumers in 50 Chinese cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, with prices for monthly plans ranging from 128 yuan ($18; £14) to 599 yuan, according to state media Xinhua.

               More than 130,000 5G base stations will be activated by the end of the year to support the 5G network, the government said in the statement.

               This would make it one of the world's largest 5G deployments, it said.
